# üõ°Ô∏è Cyber Home Lab ‚Äì From Zero to Catching Attackers  

## üìå Project Overview  
This project is a **cloud-based Home SOC (Security Operations Center)** built using Microsoft **Azure free resources**.  
The lab simulates real-world security monitoring by deploying virtual machines, enabling logging, and detecting malicious activities. 
**Goals:**  
- Build a **home lab SOC** using free cloud resources.  
- Learn how to **collect, monitor, and analyze security logs**.  
- Simulate attacks and **catch attackers in action**.

5. **Attack Simulation & Detection**  
   - Left RDP/SSH ports open to attract attackers.  
   - Captured brute-force attempts and suspicious IPs.  
   - Analyzed logs to identify malicious activity.

6. **Alerting & Insights**  
   - Configured alerts for failed logins.  
   - Visualized attacker data (IP addresses, geolocation, frequency).
